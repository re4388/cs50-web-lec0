git add 'index.html'
	let git to track it
git commit -m "msg"
	to let git to save this copy
git status
	report what's going on at this moment
git push
	push change to github

you can know go to github to see the change apple

git pull
	dl the lastest ver to my local 

you can change on github and use git pull to let local sync to remote


merge conflicts

if two people update the file with dif changes and you can't just simple git pull/date the file
since git have no idea which ver. is the one, you need resolve the dif/conflict first

demo:
you go github to change something and then commit
and then you go back to local and then change something and then you try to git pull
then the editor will let you choose which ver you will going to integrate via git push

you need to manaul edit to the code you want 
and if you commit the revised one, git this time will know what you want.




git log
	see history

git reset --hard commit-hash
git reset --hard origin/master
	go back the ver that I originally got from the repo
